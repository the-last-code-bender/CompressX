# CHANGELOG

## [1.1.0] - 2024-02-25
### Added
- **Working Directory Display:**  
  - The program now displays the current working directory before starting the process.  
  - Users are informed that all files in this directory and its subdirectories will be scanned. 
- **File Count in Confirmation Prompt:**  
  - Before compression starts, the program shows the **total number of matching files** found.  
  - This number is displayed in the confirmation message for user approval.
### Changed
- **Separated Functions for Better Clarity:**  
  - The file searching and compression processes have been split into two distinct functions:
    - `find_matching_files()` → Locates all matching files.  
    - `compress_and_delete_files()` → Handles compression and deletion.
- **Progress Tracking During Compression:**  
  - While compressing, the program now shows the **current file number** and **total file count**  
    (e.g., `[3/10] Compressed and deleted: filename.ext`).
### Fixed
- **Empty Extension Handling:**  
  - If the user presses **Enter** without typing a file extension, the program now exits gracefully with a message.
- **No Files Found Handling:**  
  - When no files match the entered extension, the program informs the user and terminates without errors.
